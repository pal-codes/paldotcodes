        <h2>Why read?</h2>
        <p>
          My original idea was to share my opinions on why everyone should
          write. But then I don’t have many blogs of mine to showcase and it
          would be impractical to preach what I don’t practise. So I turned
          towards what I do a lot of i.e. I read a lot. Reading is very natural
          to humans. We share & perceive information in text. But this is
          definitely not so natural for everyone, just like going to the gym
          regularly is not natural for everyone either. But I was an avid book
          reader back in the school, picking up whatever titles would be
          available back then in a pretty common convent school. Reading as many
          as I could in an academic year, hoping to go big the next one was my
          chime.

          I don’t read as many books today. But I still do a lot of reading
          everyday. Mostly in the form of articles, writings, blogs, by people I
          follow or come across on social media. These could be all about things
          like life, engineering to travel, health, finance, etc.

          What does reading give you? Reading builds a perspective. Reading
          allows you to understand society’s opinions on topics of matter.
          Reading can be a calming activity for our ever-active brains. It truly
          feels therapeutic to be completely drawn in on a white page with some
          text on it, that somehow seems to build a bridge between you and the
          writer. With above point in context, reading makes you relate to the
          writer - who could be someone more experienced in a specific art,
          skill and that allows you to be inspired and create something of your
          own. (Which is why this article exists). Conclusion Reading is what
          eventually brought me to writing this article. I have come across so
          many interesting engineers who write to express their views and share
          their experiences. I would like to achieve a similar glimpse through
          my writing and become part of the community that loves to give back.
