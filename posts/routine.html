        <h2>Routine</h2>
        <p>
          I have been fortunate enough to have worked with and met a lot of
          great engineers in my life, and would love to meet more. I have
          written some personal logs on what I have learnt from each experience,
          but this article captures a singular pick that I have noticed with
          almost everyone I have met, that they all have a routine, a system.
          Not a timetable, not a specifically defined set of hours where they
          work in focus. But it's a system they have kept or built for
          themselves over time where they have now become immune to changes in
          their environment, days and other parameters. Nothing can break their
          focus, their processes and their productivity.
          <br />
          I believe I have been able to achieve some of that myself. Here goes:
        </p>

        <p>
          I wake up anywhere around 4 to 6 AM, that gives me a lot of control on
          how I steer my day ahead. Then I work on the most primary task for the
          day. But making sure that it needs to be wrapped up with a run before
          8. I allow myself to be creative during these hours.
        </p>

        <p>
          Then I return home, making myself some coffee. During this hour, I
          talk to my partner due to time difference. And then I get back to plan
          for the day, this is where I have set a strict time rule for 10AM to
          4PM - no unnecessary social interactions or other dopamine hits unless
          for work or pre-decided. This is the time that I believe allows me to
          build patience and discipline. A lot of distraction due to mobile
          usage, social media, videos can happen during this time if not curbed.
        </p>

        <p>
          Usually end my day after this with some logging about the day, and
          some light exercise, or yoga. I do some reading wherever I walk to,
          usually to a cafe nearby. Sometimes I like to code a little more
          before I sleep, but I have noticed that destroys my ability to sleep
          then.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyway, this is my process. I could wake up a little bit later, but
          that really doesn&apos;t do any harm. I get right to what I would do.
          Maybe I will miss a focus session, I could pull that in later.
        </p>

        <p>
          I don&apos;t remember where I read this "To be able to do a certain
          thing, you have to be a certain person" or something along the lines.
          If I find out where I read it, I will add it here. But this is
          basically what brought me to thinking about building my routine and
          sticking to it.
