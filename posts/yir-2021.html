            This is a collection of my learnings & experiences throughout the
            year 2021 and the processes I want to see myself building through
            2022.
          </p>

          <p>
            Just got back from a run. I’ve been in Pune about a month now for
            work and this is sort of my first experience living away from the
            family. After having been stuck at home turning 21 in the middle of
            a pandemic, this felt like a great getaway. And it is. Learning so
            much about myself, through the habits I’ve built over the two weeks
            to let myself focus and form a good balance between life and work
            here.
          </p>

          <p>
            It’s October, and now I have an M1 MacBook Air, my first ever Apple
            product. God! How are they so good with building laptops! Sitting at
            a cafe in Mumbai and trying to switch to this app called Bear notes
            for writing my blogs and I’m already loving it. It’s minimal, clean
            and allows me to focus on my process of writing without having to
            switch context too often. I can work with MarkDown, so instead of
            having to move my cursor to different places around the interfaces,
            I can very easily just keep typing in a WYSIWYG manner.
          </p>

            This was originally supposed to be a recording of my thoughts
            throughout the year, but seems like I didn’t come back very often to
            this page. But I still wanna include a few things I wanna reflect
            back on and what how I see myself moving along in 2022. As an
            engineer I never over-estimate or over-promise. I’ve learnt this
            lesson through some very practical bad experiences in product
            management. This keeps me and the people working with me happy and
            on track. I don’t plan to change my thinking about this as this has
            greatly benefited me in terms of my work-life balance. I’ve very
            rarely had to wake up until late to finish up on some work
            throughout 2021.

            Here at the Araku Cafe in Indiranagar, Bangalore at the time of
            writing this para. People all around me chatting and enjoying their
            cups of coffee. I love being in cafes and sometimes just being an
            observer. Interesting how everyone sitting there is present at the
            same time in the same city at the same place, even though having
            lived completely unique lives before that point. In Bangalore, I am
            here to meet my team members. I personally find it refreshing to
            join my team and work with them in person as opposed to sitting at
            home at my table, with nothing but Alexa to notify me about my day.
            Currently, I handle the product related work. Anything from deciding
            what goes in and what needs to be fixed on a daily basis. What’s
            very new in this for me is the backend is a blockchain. Yes it’s a
            web3 startup and definitely wasn’t on my plan. All of it happened
            over a quick call with a friend and me showing interest in this
            ever-growing community.
          </p>

          <p>
            Apart from learning new things, meeting new people, visiting new
            cities, one other thing I’ve made consistent efforts for is to be
            fit. I was overweight a year ago. I achieved my target weight in
            2021, and I plan to keep this on and keep improving on my form and
            agility. I run very regularly, but recently sort of added working
            out and HIIT exercises to the jam. Let’s see how this goes in 2022.
            I will write another piece about this later, because I do have come
            across many engineers/designers (including all sedentary jobs)
            facing similar fitness issues, because of the nature of our work.
          </p>

          <p>
            I’m still learning to make better use of my time. I’ve never really
            planned my days, weeks. I learnt the real value of time this year. I
            had never really given so much thought to my schedules, things I do
            in a day. But I want to, why, because I feel planning ur day sort of
            slows down the pace and presents the day in front of you with
            usually a doable enough list of tasks to get away with. You have
            more granular view of your day, allowing you to add slots where you
            can take a break every now and then, do more than just work in a
            day.
          </p>

          <p>
            One more thing! I want to write more. I keep saying this and keep
            missing out the point, but I feel like I’ve found a rhythm and a
            reason now to write more about what and how I am learning things, my
            experiences meeting new people, traveling to new cities.
