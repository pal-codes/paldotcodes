            Hello dear netizen! You seem to have stumbled upon my html.<br />
            This collection of english words I am putting together aims to make
            good use of your time here. I will be writing about tech, my
            opinions about the world, prose or stanzas, experiences, short
            notes, ideas - all here. <br />I graduated in 2022, but I have been
            working more or less since I was 17 or maybe 16 if you count a
            completely unpaid C# project. <br />Currently I am researching,
            building products that make mindful use of LLMs or AI. I have been
            cognizant to the notion that AI in its current state is nothing but
            thousands of different UIs centered around a textbox. I believe a
            good product should challenge that norm. <br />Areas of product that
            intrigue me in general are 'tools for thought' and 'knowledge/text
            segmentation'. I have been day-dreaming a software paradigm that
            lets humans interact with their knowledge in physical form.
