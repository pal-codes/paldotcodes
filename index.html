          Hi fellow reader, netizen, explorer, thanks for visiting my page. This
          collection of english words is me sharing my thoughts about life as I
          go through it. I believe writing is a very powerful medium to express
          oneself, and I would like to enable that transmission of experiences,
          observation on this page.
        </p>
        <p>
          Graduated out of college in 2022, but I have been working more or less
          since I was 16/17. I write a lot, with a record of the time and place
          sometimes (more recently).
