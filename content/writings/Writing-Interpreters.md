> This post will be updated as I learn more

I am writing this journal to capture my experience of writing my own interpreter. I currently work full time as a product engineer at a web3 company so that leaves me with very less time to work on personal side projects. But I kept coming back to this feeling of being left with a lot more to desire from myself, that I wasn’t learning enough, that I wasn’t experimenting enough.

So as a first few forays of me building, I am picking up writing my own interpreter/compiler. Maybe I believe this will lead me to; sometime later; even write my own programming language. I would be a very happy man when I do so.

I have always been intrigued by lower level computing *stuff* ( don’t know yet what to call it, so *stuff* it is ). I have been a casual linux user since I was 13-14 years old. When I first went to check out the linux repo on GitHub, instantly found myself backing out from exploring any further being scared of the crazy amounts of C code I just crashed into. Then a few months I spent learning Java, then some HTML and web stuff and then later built a desktop app written in C# and .Net for a client guided by my dad. I have this feeling inside that I have always worked on projects that were lead my other not me, or I was somehow not the driving motivation behind building something. But I believe it’s time I start doing things on my own term, to have my own agency. [The Most Precious Resource is Agency - by Simon Sarris](https://simonsarris.substack.com/p/the-most-precious-resource-is-agency?utm_source=url). And programming languages have always had my fancy.

One other reason could be because, I was a big literature nerd back in my convent school days and would read whatever few books I could come across in the small less-stocked convent library, but I was big on English grammar. I loved it.
Taking sentences and then diving deeper looking at each word, like a building block, and then finding their purpose and their structure in the sentence and how they bring meaning to it. I believe writing compilers/interpreters is very similar at least from what I have read up till now. So I am very excited to pick this up.

A few resources that I have started this process with and will keep referring to.
