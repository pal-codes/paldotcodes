## Greetings, I'm Aayush

I'm a product engineer currently building for [myself](https://github.com/palcodes) and [Market.xyz](https://market.xyz). 
I like to contribute on many levels, all the way from design to prod. 
I am a people person, and I care more about empathetic teams than extremely crisp code.

I learn best by building stuff and getting my hands dirty. If you wanna talk about tech, life, finance or about anything else that makes you roll - feel free to reach out to me on twitter [@pal_codes](https://twitter.com/pal_codes).

Very often I find myself in the **think-wish-forget** loop. I created this blog as a way for me to get out of this loop and start to **think-do-iterate**. The fact that there's overwhelmingly vast amounts of pure knowledge everywhere on the internet, I was fascinated by the idea of having my own corner where I can post my little perspectives on them.

While constantly juggling through all kinds of emotions, experiences that life has to throw at me, I feel collected, resolved when I come across articles that inspire me in the most grounded manner, providing the most practical approach to forming a constructive habit. One such treasure is [Linus's blog](https://thesephist.com) and I'm shamelessly using his theme [Carlisle](https://carlisle.thesephist.vercel.app) as a base for my blog as it hit just the right chords with my current writing needs. I will on the side, work on my own version of the design and will release that when ready. No promises.

I want this blog to be a public collection of my musings about life, tech, worlds and everything in between.
