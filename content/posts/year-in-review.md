It’s October, trying to put my thoughts down on bear notes. Recently purchased a MacBook Air, definitely a life changing one. It’s one of the best hardware experiences I’ve ever had in my life. The sheer comfort and relaxed mind when using this machine is much appreciated.

I remember when I first sat down to jot down my thoughts about 2021, I was left with nothing but the title. This is my first time writing an article about how I spent my year.

What I hope to achieve out of writing this - basically to be reflect better on what occurred, happened over the year and things that I can improve upon in the coming year. I’m not the kind of person who overpromises, usually very underwhelming about guessing my abilities. So what I hope to get better at throughout 2022, is to pick up things I’d never thought I can do and work on them. Because, things did happen in 2021, things I never thought I could achieve. Built more products with people I really appreciate the chance to have worked with. And folks that I am gonna work with in the near future.

The switch to web3 is definitely not something I could have predicted. All of it happened over a quick call with my friend and him showing an interest.

Achieved my target weight.

Find more time to write more. Because in the end it helps me feel productive. Writing is definitely a habit I wanna build over time.
I am enjoying using vscode for my writing, because it has the same feeling of me writing siting in a cafe and still no one can really understand what exactly i'm upto.
I'm still learning to make better use of my time. There's a lot of stuff that I've learnt throughout 2021, and it definitely feels like the most happening year of my already.
What is the most important to thing in a day? -> To basically believe in your abilities and appreciate the opportunities you recieved and admire the way you made use of them.
I am sitting at the Araku cafe here in Indiranagar, Bangalore at the time of writing this para. People here are of all sorts, definitely of the rich kind.
Finally it's the 31st of December and I'm home for a week or two, after which I'll be moving into Bangalore. This is the biggest decision I've made yet in my life, the biggest step I've taken.
