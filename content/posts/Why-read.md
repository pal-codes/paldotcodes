I was originally planning to share my opinions about why people should write blogs. But then I realised, I don’t have many blogs on my own website and I am not happy doing that, feels impractical. So the next thing that came to my mind was this title. I read a lot, like A LOT.

Reading is very natural to humans. We share & perceive information in text. But this is definitely not so natural for everyone, just like going to the gym regularly is not natural for everyone either. But I was an avid book reader back in the school, picking up whatever titles would be available back then in a pretty common convent school. Reading as many as I could in an academic year, hoping to go big the next one was my chime.

I don’t read as many books today. But I still do a lot of reading everyday. Mostly in the form of articles, writings, blogs, by people I follow or come across on social media. These could be all about things like life, engineering to travel, health, finance, etc.

* Reading builds a perspective.
* Reading allows you to understand society’s opinions on topics of matter.
* Reading is a calming activity. It truly feel therapeutic to be completely drawn in on a white page with some text on it, that somehow seems to build a bridge between you and the writer.
* This is in context, reading makes you relate to the writer - who could be someone more experienced in a specific art, skill and allow you to be inspired and create something of your own. (Which is why this article)
